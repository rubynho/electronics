# Fundamentals of Electricity

### The big four

The four properties that drive the entire industry of electricity are:

- Voltage
- Current
- Resistance
- Power

If you know what is going on with voltage, current, resistance and power, you know what is going on inside the circuit.

Everything that it pertains to electricity and electronics is traceable back to Matter. Matter is anything that occupies space and has weight.

### Elements

- Basic building blocks of nature.
- Cannot be reduce to a simpler substance by chemical means.
- Over 100 known elements (literally **everything** is made out of these 100 plus elements).

### Parts of an atom

- Nucleus
  - Located at center of atom.

- Protons
  - Positively charged particles inside nucleus.

- Neutrons
  - Uncharged particles inside nucleus.

- Electrons
  - Negatively charged particles that orbit nucleus.

As an electronic technician the most important part of an atom is the Electrons.
